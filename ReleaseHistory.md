# v1.0.7 #

This is another minor release primarily in support of projects deployed on the platform.

**Release Date:** 10 April 2012

  * Installation of Sonar on the build server has instigated wide spread standards checking and 'best practice' compliance across the codebase. This is only in its infancy, but you can always check out the [Sonar dashboard](https://redbox-build.cqu.edu.au/sonar/) as this will be an ongoing effort.
  * Drop down lists in Jaffa can now accept a 'description' field from a data source. [r3163](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3163), [r3165](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3165)

  * JsonVelocity contrib plugin updated to provide access to system configuration inside templates. [r3126](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3126)

# v1.0.5 #

Major works on system messaging for robustness and improved functionality. The Solr Event Log Subscriber and the ReIndex tool also got some long overdue tender loving care.

**Release Date:** 04 October 2011

**Release Notes:**

  * Stage 2 [restore tool](BackupMigrationToolPlanning.md) implemented ([issue #10](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#10)), allowing harvest file OID remapping and inclusion of custom migration scripts. ([issue #57](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#57)) Migration from one host to another should now be possible.
  * Added new 'History' screen to display Solr log for object. [r3071](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3071)
  * Solr logging configuration fixed. ([issue #58](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#58))
  * Numerous minor fixes to 'about' pages. ([issue #54](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#54), [issue #55](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#55), [issue #56](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#56))
  * Object deletion is more robust when small sections error. [r3064](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3064)
  * Some timing issues and bugs resolved in SubscriberQueueConsumer. ID generation now uses [UUIDs](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html) [r3080](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3080)
  * Significant work on messaging: [r3083](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3083)
    * Some core messaging features previously in the Portal having been centralised to the Core Library. It is now possible to start AMQ without a Portal from inside unit tests.
    * Message queue bootup delays at system start are no longer hardcoded. Servers with slow Solr boot times can accommodate.
    * Some new experimental work on transaction management provides alternative to traditional tool chains. A new '`TransactionManager`' plugin supports this.
    * '`MessagingServices`' should handle a lot of edge case errors to do with abnormally terminating sessions. It is also quite trivial now to send JMS messages to other systems as well.
    * Message statistics can now be routed by configuration, and disabled if desired.
  * Objects posting messages to the tool chain can now be configured regarding the specific queue to use. [r3085](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/source/detail?r=3085)

# v1.0.4 #

This release focuses on significant updates to the [logging framework](LoggingFrameworks.md) 'plumbing' throughout the platform. There are also a number of bug fixes and the test release of a new restoration process.

**Release Date:** 22 August 2011

**Release Notes:**

  * Work on [logging frameworks](LoggingFrameworks.md) to address bugs caused by Solr version upgrade.
  * Solr Indexer now binds access to the '`log`' object to the Jython engine, making it accessible inside of rules files. ([issue #43](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#43))
  * Implement [Stage 1 of re-index/restore](BackupMigrationToolPlanning.md) tool. ([issue #46](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#46))
  * Minor improvement to File System Storage Plugin when it finds objects without an 'objectId' property. Needs further work ([issue #48](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#48)), this 'fix' is just a workaround.
  * FileSystemHarvester's new database cache has been added to developer purge scripts. ([issue #6](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#6))
  * Fixed an occasional number parsing error in House Keeping. ([issue #8](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#8)).
  * Some work-around fixes to OAI-PMH harvest problems added to sample rules file. More work is required in the harvester ([issue #49](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#49)).
  * Fixed threading bug in file lock unit test. ([issue #28](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#28))
  * Improved several contrib plugins to allow the [build server](https://redbox-build.cqu.edu.au/jenkins/) to do automated documentation builds now that they are separated from the core Fascinator POMs.
  * Fixed Atom Feed bugs resulting from code being out-of-date. ([issue #50](https://code.google.com/p/the-fascinator/issues/detail?id=#50))
